# Screenscribe Directory Merge Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-21
**Task**: Merge two screenscribe directories into main location

## Directory Locations

1. **Main Location** (target): `/Users/grimm/coding/gits/active/ai-tools/screenscribe`
2. **Secondary Location** (source): `/Users/grimm/coding/screenscribe`

## Files Successfully Merged

### âœ… Completed
1. **PRP-multi-backend-audio.md**
   - From: `/Users/grimm/coding/screenscribe/docs/PRP-multi-backend-audio.md`
   - To: `/Users/grimm/coding/gits/active/ai-tools/screenscribe/PRPs/PRP-multi-backend-audio.md`
   - Status: Successfully copied

2. **PRD.md (with technical discoveries)**
   - From: `/Users/grimm/coding/screenscribe/docs/PRD.md`
   - To: `/Users/grimm/coding/gits/active/ai-tools/screenscribe/docs/PRD-updated.md`
   - Status: Copied as PRD-updated.md (review and merge with existing prd_screenscribe.md)

## Analysis of Secondary Location

### Empty/Duplicate Files (No Action Needed)
- `Makefile` (0 bytes - empty)
- `pyproject.toml` (0 bytes - empty)
- `src/screenscribe/` (empty directory)
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` (0 bytes - empty)

### Potentially Duplicate Files
- `docs/PRP.md` - Appears to be same as `PRPs/prp_screenscribe_enhanced.md` in main location
- `README.md` - Main location has more complete version (6.9KB vs 2.6KB)

### Unique to Secondary Location
- `.git/` directory (separate git repository)
- Potentially different examples or scripts (need further investigation)

## Recommendations

1. **Review PRD Updates**: Compare `docs/PRD-updated.md` with `docs/prd_screenscribe.md` and merge the technical discoveries section

2. **Check for Unique Content**:
   ```bash
   # Check examples directory
   diff -r /Users/grimm/coding/screenscribe/examples /Users/grimm/coding/gits/active/ai-tools/screenscribe/examples
   
   # Check scripts directory
   diff -r /Users/grimm/coding/screenscribe/scripts /Users/grimm/coding/gits/active/ai-tools/screenscribe/scripts
   
   # Check tests directory
   diff -r /Users/grimm/coding/screenscribe/tests /Users/grimm/coding/gits/active/ai-tools/screenscribe/tests
   ```

3. **Git History**: The secondary location has its own `.git` directory. Consider if any commits need to be preserved.

4. **Cleanup**: After verifying all important content is merged, the secondary directory can be removed or archived.
