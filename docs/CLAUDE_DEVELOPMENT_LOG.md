**Context**: User reported regression where MLX backend was no longer being automatically selected on Apple Silicon, falling back to CPU-only faster-whisper instead. Investigation revealed this occurred after the Pydantic v2 fix when the installation command was run without the `[apple]` dependencies.

**Root Cause**: 
- When fixing the Pydantic issue, used `uv tool install --editable . --force` 
- This missed the Apple Silicon dependencies specified in `[apple]` optional group
- MLX backend was unavailable in the uv tool environment despite being available in system Python
- Auto-selection correctly fell back to faster-whisper as expected

**Changes**:
- **Corrected Installation Command**: Used `uv tool install --editable './[apple]' --force` to include MLX dependencies
- **Environment Verification**: Confirmed mlx-whisper installation in correct uv tool environment
- **Backend Testing**: Verified MLX backend availability and auto-selection logic

**Validation**:
- Confirmed `screenscribe --list-backends` now shows MLX as available with GPU device
- Verified auto-selection prioritizes MLX backend on Apple Silicon systems
- Tested backend detection logic works correctly in installed environment
- MLX backend now properly detected: `✅ mlx: gpu (float16)`

**Benefits**:
- **✅ Apple Silicon Performance Restored**: MLX GPU acceleration automatically selected again
- **✅ Proper Dependency Management**: Apple Silicon users get correct installation
- **✅ Backend Auto-Selection Working**: Intelligent backend selection functioning as designed
- **✅ No Code Changes Needed**: Issue was purely installation/environment related

**Notes**:
- This highlights importance of testing installations after dependency changes
- The backend selection logic itself was correct - issue was missing dependencies
- Reinforces need to always use `./[apple]` syntax for Apple Silicon installations
- Critical reminder to test full installation flow after making dependency updates
- Auto-selection now correctly prioritizes: MLX (Apple Silicon GPU) → faster-whisper (CPU fallback)

## DEVLOG-018: Optimize Defaults for Educational Content with Trading-Specific Prompts (2025-07-21)

**Context**: Based on real-world testing with trading education video, identified that default scene detection settings (0.3 threshold) severely under-sampled educational content, missing 99% of frames including critical "magnitude of move" discussion at 15:13. User requested optimizing defaults for educational/training content.

**Changes**:
- **Updated Default Sampling Mode**: Changed from `scene` to `interval` sampling
- **Updated Default Interval**: Changed from 5.0 seconds to 45.0 seconds  
- **CLI Help Text**: Updated to indicate defaults are "optimized for educational content"
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated usage guide to reflect new defaults and examples
- **Trading-Specific Prompts**: Created specialized `prompts-trading/synthesis.md` for financial education content
- **Models & CLI Alignment**: Ensured ProcessingOptions and CLI argument defaults match

**Validation**:
- Default behavior now captures 67 frames vs previous 3 frames (22x improvement)
- Educational content like lectures, tutorials, presentations get comprehensive coverage
- Trading education video now captures 15:13 "magnitude of move" content in Frame 20
- CLI help text correctly shows new defaults: `[default: interval]` and `[default: 45.0]`
- Scene detection still available for content with dramatic visual changes

**Benefits**:
- **✅ Better Out-of-Box Experience**: Educational content works well without configuration
- **✅ Comprehensive Coverage**: 45-second intervals provide thorough content sampling
- **✅ Trading Content Optimized**: Specialized prompts for financial education analysis
- **✅ Backward Compatible**: Scene detection still available for appropriate content
- **✅ User-Friendly Defaults**: No need to specify sampling flags for most use cases

**Content Type Recommendations**:
- **Educational/Tutorial Content**: Default interval sampling (now default)
- **Movies/TV Shows**: Use `--sampling-mode scene` for dramatic cut detection  
- **Trading/Financial Education**: Use `--prompts-dir ./prompts-trading/`
- **Technical Presentations**: Default 45s intervals work well, or use 30s for detailed content

**Notes**:
- This addresses the core issue where educational content was severely under-sampled
- Trading education example went from unusable (3 frames) to comprehensive (67 frames)  
- Defaults now favor comprehensive coverage over processing speed optimization
- Scene detection remains optimal for content with clear visual transitions
- Specialized trading prompts focus on chart patterns, technical analysis, and market concepts
