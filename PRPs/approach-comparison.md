# Screenscribe-Fabric Integration: Approach Comparison

## Migration Approach (v1.0) vs Wrapper Approach (v2.0)

### Migration Approach
**Concept:** Full integration - rewrite Screenscribe within Fabric's Go codebase

**Pros:**
- Single unified codebase
- Native Go performance
- Deep integration possibilities

**Cons:**
- 4-week implementation timeline
- Requires Go expertise
- Risk of losing Python ML optimizations
- Complex migration for existing users
- Significant changes to Fabric core

**Effort:** High
**Risk:** High
**Timeline:** 4 weeks

### Wrapper/Extension Approach âœ…
**Concept:** Add video processing as helper tools that pipe to Fabric patterns

**Pros:**
- 2-week implementation timeline
- Minimal changes to Fabric core
- Preserves Python ML performance
- Simple installation process
- Works with existing Fabric workflow
- Easy to maintain and update
- Users can mix and match components

**Cons:**
- Separate tools to install
- Dependency on Python runtime
- Slightly less integrated feel

**Effort:** Low
**Risk:** Low
**Timeline:** 2 weeks

## Implementation Simplicity

### Migration Approach:
```
1. Rewrite entire Screenscribe codebase in Go
2. Integrate deeply with Fabric internals
3. Create new command structure
4. Migrate all users
5. Maintain backward compatibility
```

### Wrapper Approach:
```
1. Create 2-3 helper tools
2. Write a few Fabric patterns
3. Document usage
4. Done!
```

## User Experience Comparison

### Migration:
```bash
# After complex migration
fabric screenscribe video.mp4 --lots-of-options
```

### Wrapper:
```bash
# Simple and Fabric-like
video_analyze video.mp4 | fabric -p analyze_video_content
```

## Recommendation: Wrapper Approach

The wrapper approach aligns perfectly with Fabric's Unix philosophy of small, composable tools. It's simpler, faster to implement, and maintains the best of both worlds - Screenscribe's specialized video processing and Fabric's powerful pattern system.
